<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>In this sketchy and unpretentious booklet the reader
must not expect to find any thoroughgoing or penetrating
discussion of Haydn&rsquo;s works or, for that matter, more
than a hasty and superficial account of his career. Haydn
wrote an appalling quantity of music, some of which has
to this day not been finally catalogued. In a pamphlet
of this brief and unoriginal sort the reader will look in
vain for anything more than the titles of a handful of
compositions. About the vast number of symphonies, the
magnificent string quartets, the clavier works, the songs
there can here be no question. Nor can one do more than
allude to a few of the stage pieces though these operas,
composed for the most part for the festivities arranged
by the Eszterh&aacute;zy princes, do not pretend to fill a role in
the history of the lyric drama comparable to those of
Mozart or even to the <i>intermezzi</i> and the <i>buffas</i> of the
18th Century Italians or the <i>Singspiele</i> of men like Dittorsdorf
and Hiller. Neither is there room to consider the
technical advancements achieved by Haydn in the sonata
or symphonic form. Yet, even a rapid glance through the
following pages will, none the less, make it clear that
Haydn, barring a few hardships in his youth, lived an
extraordinarily fortunate life and had abundant reason
for the optimism which marked every step of his progress.
Not even Mendelssohn was so unendingly lucky, whether
in his spiritual constitution or in his year by year
experiences. That Haydn was a master by the grace of
Heaven and a servant only by the artificial conventions
of a temporary social order must become clear to anyone
who follows his amazing development in the biography
of Pohl and Botstiber, or the briefer but no less deeply
perceptive accounts of a scholar like Dr. Karl Geiringer,
on whose writings and analyses the present little account
is chiefly based.</p>

<h1 title="">JOSEPH HAYDN
<br /><span class="small"><i>Servant and Master</i></span></h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p class="tb">When Mendelssohn first heard Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grand Organ
Mass&rdquo; he found it &ldquo;scandalously merry.&rdquo; Now, this
work, composed at Eszterh&aacute;za in 1766, was by no means
a mature effort and it might have been reasonable to
ascribe its exuberance to the high spirits of a young man
of uncommonly slow artistic development. But the fact
is that, virtually to the end of his days, Haydn did not
outgrow a joyfulness rooted in an unfaltering optimism
of soul. This is not to say that his creative inspiration and
originality did not enormously deepen and ramify and,
particularly in his later years, foreshadow in startling
fashion some of the most influential romantic devices of
the nineteenth century. Yet his heart preserved unchanged
that serene geniality of his youth. As much as
anything else his churchly compositions disclose this
trait, and even his later masses are distinguished by a
good deal of that &ldquo;merriment&rdquo; which shocked Mendelssohn
and not a few others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do it otherwise,&rdquo; he once told
his friend, the poet Carpani, when the question of his
treatment of the mass came up. &ldquo;I have to give what is
in me! When I think of God, my heart is so full of joy
that the notes fly from me as from a spindle. And as God
has given me a joyful heart He will surely pardon me if
I serve Him cheerfully!&rdquo; With these words he set about
revising that selfsame &ldquo;scandalously jolly&rdquo; Mass of 1766,
making it even more &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; by the addition of
some cheery wind instrument parts. Having finished a
work and signed it, he would almost unfailingly add a
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
pious inscription, such as &ldquo;Soli Deo Gloria&rdquo;, &ldquo;Laus Deo&rdquo;
or &ldquo;In Nomine Domini&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One of the outstanding authorities on Haydn today,
Dr. Karl Geiringer, alludes to the &ldquo;deep religious sense,
stubborn tenacity of purpose and a passionate desire to
rise in the world&rdquo; as qualities which could be found in
all Haydn&rsquo;s ancestors, &ldquo;combined with a great pride in
good craftsmanship, a warm love of the soil and a healthy
streak of sensuality.&rdquo; Certainly, his boyhood was not
calculated to make of him an incorrigible optimist had
not this quality been bred in his bones. Rohrau, the little
town in which he was born, is an unattractive place in a
flat and marshy country, where the frequently overflowing
Leitha River forms a border between Austria and
Hungary. The houses are low, built of clay and roofed
with thatch, which often catches fire in the hot, dry
summers. Dr. Geiringer tells that Haydn&rsquo;s house was
burned in 1813, 1833 and 1899, but always restored so
carefully that few but specialists could tell the difference.
The place was probably no worse than other neighboring
cottages and farms; yet we are told that Beethoven, in
his last illness, being shown a picture of it, exclaimed:
&ldquo;To think that such a great man should have been born
in so poor a home!&rdquo; while some years later, Liszt, on
catching sight of it, burst into tears.</p>

<p>Haydn&rsquo;s father, Mathias Haydn, was born in the
nearby town of Hainburg; his antecedents were hard-working,
honest men, farmers, vinegrowers, millers,
wheel-wrights. Of musicians or artists there was not one
among them. Mathias was a wheel-wright and wagon-builder,
like his forebears. When he finished his apprenticeship
he set out on a trip, after the tradition of a
journeyman, and went, we are told, as far as Frankfurt-on-the-Main.
On his wanderings he bought himself a
harp. Someone taught him to play it (he could not read
a note of music) sufficiently to accompany himself in
his favorite folk-tunes, which he sang &ldquo;in a pleasant
tenor voice&rdquo;. In 1727 he settled in Rohrau, though he
remained a member of the Hainburg guild of wheel-wrights.
It is possible that he chose the unattractive
market town in place of the more imposing and picturesque
Hainburg because Maria Koller lived in Rohrau.
Maria was a cook in the employ of the Counts of Harrach,
the lords of Rohrau. She appears to have been a
clever culinary artist (Dr. Geiringer says she &ldquo;had to
handle such delicacies as turtles and crayfish and had an
abundance of material at her disposal.&rdquo; We are told for
example, that something like 8000 eggs, 200 capons and
300 chickens were delivered annually to the castle by
the inhabitants of Rohrau as part of their duties to their
patron.) At any rate, in 1728, she married the wagon-maker,
Mathias Haydn, and brought her husband a
dowry of 120 florins and an &ldquo;honest outfit.&rdquo; The couple
was by no means what could be called &ldquo;poor&rdquo; (in spite
of Beethoven&rsquo;s pathetic exclamation and Liszt&rsquo;s tears!),
but Maria Haydn saw to it that ends met, as they had to,
considering there were twelve children (of whom half
died in infancy). Moreover she was a model housewife
and had inherited a deeply religious strain. It was
her fondest wish to see her great son become a Catholic
priest rather than prefer &ldquo;the irresponsible life of a musician.&rdquo;
She, alas, did not live to witness his first artistic
successes. As for Mathias, who was very adequately paid
for doing all sorts of odd jobs for the Counts of Harrach,
his wife had the satisfaction of seeing him succeed her
father in the judicial office of &ldquo;Marktrichter.&rdquo; He was
&ldquo;responsible for the good conduct of the population,
kept a sharp look-out for adultery and gambling; saw
that people went to church and did not break the Sunday
rest ... while every Sunday morning at 6 he had to
report to the steward of Count Harrach&rdquo; (Geiringer).
He had a wine cellar, farmland and cattle. He and his
wife were of Austro-German origin, not Hungarians or
Croats.</p>
<p>Franz Joseph Haydn (his family called their children
by their second names&mdash;hence the famous brother,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Johann Michael, has come down into history as Michael
Haydn) was born on March 31, 1732, the second child
of the Haydn couple. In only one respect did he show
himself different from his paternal and maternal ancestors&mdash;at
an astonishingly early age &ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; (Austrian
diminutive for Joseph) manifested musical talent.
This talent took the form of a gift for singing, a lovely
voice and an amazingly correct intonation, not to mention
a sense of rhythm which disclosed itself in various
ways. If he had no skill in playing any kind of instrument
(though he greatly wished to imitate his father&rsquo;s performances
on the harp) he would find himself a couple
of sticks and by means of these try to &ldquo;play&rdquo; the violin,
as he had seen the Rohrau schoolmaster do. The wonder
of the neighbors became aroused, and the more &ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo;
gave signs of other than simply manual abilities the more
ardently his mother prayed that heaven might make him
a teacher or, better still, a priest. For the last, the boy
actually displayed a predisposition. The child had a
streak of piety in him which remained with the man to
the end.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>One day a cousin of Mathias, a certain Johann Mathias
Franck, came over from Hainburg. Franck seemed a person
sent by Providence to further Maria Haydn&rsquo;s wishes.
He was a school official, as well as precentor of the
Church of St. Philip and St. James. At once he noticed
&ldquo;Sepperl&rsquo;s&rdquo; musical inclinations and told the parents
they would be wise to allow him to take the boy to Hainburg,
where he could be more thoroughly schooled than
in Rohrau. Naturally, he was ready to supply the youngster&rsquo;s
bed and board (for which, he assumed, his cousin
Mathias would be willing to pay). The good Maria hesitated.
&ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; was not yet six and though he would
not be far away she felt uncertain how soon or how often
she might see her boy. And what of those holy orders?
Franck brushed the objections aside; the boy should
have care and understanding, not to forget an education
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
unobtainable in a village. Moreover, if &ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; were
eventually to take holy orders his musical training would
be most helpful.</p>
<p>The die was cast! The barely six year old lad left his
father&rsquo;s roof, never to return, save for a most brief and
infrequent visit. &ldquo;Sepperl&rsquo;s&rdquo; mother was right. To all
intents, the boy had left his family forever. Yet throughout
his life Haydn harbored the tenderest feelings for his
mother and never reproached her for permitting him to
leave her. &ldquo;She had always given the most tender care
to his welfare&rdquo;, he told his intimates when he was an old
man. And Karl Geiringer, in his beautiful Haydn biography,
recounts how, in 1795, &ldquo;when the then world-famous
composer visited Rohrau to see the monument
erected in his honor by Count Harrach, he knelt down
and kissed the threshold of the humble cottage he had
shared with his parents for less than six years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impressions crowded on &ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; in Hainburg. He
had numerous opportunities to assist Franck in his miscellaneous
and seemingly unending tasks in the school
house, on the organ bench, in conducting the singers and
instrumentalists at church services. One of the duties of
Franck (and to some extent, no doubt, of the boy Haydn)
was to keep the church register, look after the church
clock and ring the bells for services &ldquo;and for special occasions,
such as thunderstorms&rdquo;. In an autobiographical
sketch which Haydn wrote in 1778 he said, among other
things: &ldquo;Our Almighty Father had endowed me with so
much facility in music that even in my sixth year I stood
up like a man and sang Masses in the church choir and I
could play a little on the clavier and violin.&rdquo; And his
biographer, Georg August Griesinger, tells that Haydn
studied &ldquo;the kettledrum as well as other instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; was kept at work without respite, but he
apparently throve on all this learning, all this musical
practice and all the household chores which Franck&rsquo;s
wife heaped upon him. Juliana Franck was not at all
like his mother. If she expected the boy to help in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
household she did not worry about his increasing untidiness.
&ldquo;I could not help perceiving&rdquo;, said Haydn in
his old age when he talked of his Hainburg experiences
&ldquo;that I was gradually getting very dirty, and though I
thought rather highly of my little person, I was not always
able to avoid stains on my clothes&mdash;of which I was
dreadfully ashamed; in fact I was a regular little ragamuffin!&rdquo;
Like Schubert at the &ldquo;Konvikt&rdquo; he was grossly
&ldquo;undernourished&rdquo;. He wore a wig &ldquo;for cleanliness&rsquo; sake&rdquo;.
Yet his education, both musical and otherwise, was
greatly furthered by his sojourn in Hainburg. Even if he
was hungry and dirty, nothing embittered him. And in
after years he said of Franck: &ldquo;I shall be grateful to that
man as long as I live, for keeping me so hard at work.&rdquo;
And he had a picture of his early master wherever he
lived, besides remembering Franck&rsquo;s daughter in his will.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Now, however, occurred another of those strokes of
good fortune which punctuated Haydn&rsquo;s life from his
cradle to his grave. Just as Franck turned up in Rohrau
to take him to Hainburg, so now there appeared in Hainburg
a young man from Vienna who set &ldquo;Sepperl&rsquo;s&rdquo; feet
squarely on his further path. Karl Georg Reutter, composer
and choirmaster at St. Stephen&rsquo;s in the capital, was
on a trip looking for good choristers. At Hainburg Reutter
stayed at the home of the pastor, Anton Palmb, who
immediately called his guest&rsquo;s attention to a boy from
Rohrau who had &ldquo;a weak but sweet voice.&rdquo; Haydn&rsquo;s
friend, the Italian Carpani, has left us the story of the
meeting in some detail: &ldquo;Reutter gave him a tune to
sing at sight. The precision, the purity of tone, the spirit
with which the boy executed it surprised him; but he
was especially charmed with the beauty of the young
voice. He remarked that the lad did not trill, and smilingly
asked him the reason. The boy replied promptly:
&lsquo;How can you expect me to trill when my cousin does
not know how to himself?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will teach you&rsquo;, said Reutter;
&lsquo;mark me, I will trill&rsquo;; and taking the boy between
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
his knees, he showed him how he should produce the
notes in rapid succession, control his breath, and agitate
the palate. The boy immediately made a good shake.
Reutter, enchanted with the success of his pupil, took a
plate of fine cherries and emptied them into the boy&rsquo;s
pocket. His delight may be readily conceived. Haydn
often mentioned this anecdote to me and added, laughing,
that whenever he happened to trill he still thought
he saw those beautiful cherries.&rdquo; Reutter offered to take
&ldquo;Sepperl&rdquo; to Vienna to be a choirboy at St. Stephens as
well as to give him a much more thorough musical education
than he had received so far. The matter having
been put up to his father and mother, they agreed instantly
and with delight, the more so as Reutter promised
&ldquo;to look after their boy.&rdquo; It was agreed that the lad
should start for Vienna when he was eight. His new
master gave him some exercises in scale-singing and
sight-reading to work at in the meanwhile and, while
waiting for the great day to arrive, the youngster diligently
worked by himself to develop his voice.</p>
<p>Installed at the Cantor&rsquo;s house, next to St. Stephen&rsquo;s,
in Vienna, &ldquo;Sepperl&rsquo;s&rdquo; illusions presently suffered a chill.
Reutter suddenly turned into a hard taskmaster and an
unsympathetic disciplinarian. He was responsible for the
education, feeding and clothing of his choirboys, but the
meals were wholly insufficient, indeed skimpier than what
he had in Hainburg. A. C. Dies writes: &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s stomach
had to get accustomed to continuous fasting. He tried to
make up for it with the musical &lsquo;academies&rsquo; (concerts
given by the choir in the houses of the Viennese nobility),
where refreshments were offered to the choristers. As
soon as Joseph made this discovery, so important for his
stomach, he was seized with an incredible love for &lsquo;academies&rsquo;.
He endeavored to sing as beautifully as possible
so as to be known and invited as a skilled performer,
and thus find occasions to appease his ravenous hunger.&rdquo;
Moreover Joseph&rsquo;s musical education was rather one-sided
and apart from singing and a little violin and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
clavier playing Reutter did not bother about his young
charge&rsquo;s training in musical theory. Dr. Geiringer relates
that when, on one occasion, Reutter found Joseph
working on a twelve-part &ldquo;Salve Regina&rdquo; he asked with
a sneer: &ldquo;Oh, you silly child, aren&rsquo;t two parts enough for
you?&rdquo; But that was about as much as the instruction
amounted to. Reutter was actually a composer of no inconsiderable
distinction, whose teaching could have been
of great help to the aspiring youngster. But in after years
Haydn said that he had only two lessons from this master.
All the same, he had priceless chances to hear much of
the best contemporary sacred music. To Johann Friedrich
Rochlitz he once confided: &ldquo;Proper teachers I have
never had. I always started right away with the practical
side, first in singing and playing instruments, later in
composition. I listened more than I studied but I heard
the finest music in all forms that was to be heard in my
time, and of this there was much in Vienna. Oh, so much!
I listened attentively and tried to turn to good account
what most impressed me. Thus little by little my knowledge
and my ability were developed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys from St. Stephen&rsquo;s sometimes had a chance
to perform at the Empress Maria Theresia&rsquo;s newly built
palace of Sch&ouml;nbrunn. When the choir was on one occasion
commanded to sing there Joseph, in a burst of boyish
exuberance, climbed some scaffolding and appeared
suddenly before the Empress&rsquo;s window. Unawed by the
imperial threats the boy repeated the exploit a little
later until Maria Theresia ordered the choirmaster to give
this &ldquo;fair-haired blockhead&rdquo; a proper thrashing. However,
being extremely musical herself, and a singer of
uncommon merits in the bargain, the Empress could appreciate
Joseph&rsquo;s execution of various church solos. And
he was happier than ever when Michael Haydn joined
the St. Stephen&rsquo;s choir and added his exceptionally
beautiful soprano voice, of three octaves range, to the
ensemble. Joseph was given the duty of instructing his
younger brother in a number of matters. Before long
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Michael&rsquo;s talents were such as to make him outshine
Joseph&rsquo;s. The latter does not appear to have openly displayed
any feelings of jealousy. Yet it might be inquiring
too closely to ask if the older boy was wholly pleased
when his solos were taken away from him and given to
his brother, whose singing so delighted the Emperor and
Empress that they once accorded him a special audience,
congratulated him and gave him a substantial money
present. The good Michael promptly sent half of the
money to his father, who had lately lost a cow, and gave
the rest to Reutter to save for him. Reutter took such care
of it that poor Michael never saw a penny of it!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Suddenly Joseph&rsquo;s luck seemed to turn against him.
His voice cracked. Maria Theresia began to complain,
about 1745, that the boy was &ldquo;crowing like a cock.&rdquo;
Joseph was keenly distressed, a fact which was not
lost on Reutter. He summoned Joseph and intimated
that there was a means of doing something about it.
<i>Castrati</i> had well-paid positions in the imperial chapel.
Joseph seems to have been wise enough to notify his
father. Mathias Haydn went post-haste to Vienna and
the scheme was dropped. Reutter now waited for his
next chance to be rid of a useless chorister. He soon found
it, for some imp of mischief provoked Joseph to cut off
the pig-tail of another boy. &ldquo;You will be caned on the
hand&rdquo;, shouted Reutter to the seventeen-year-old Joseph;
&ldquo;of course, you will be expelled after you have been
caned&rdquo;, he went on. And on a chilly November morning
in 1749, Haydn found himself on the street, penniless,
with exactly three torn shirts and a threadbare coat! If
he still remembered his mother&rsquo;s wish that he should
take holy orders he might presently have had a roof over
his head. But he had a deep assurance that his destiny
lay elsewhere; neither did he appeal to his father for
help, because he knew the little household at Rohrau
was at the moment passing through a financially difficult
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As he wandered irresolutely, uncertain where he could
spend the night and where his next meal would come
from, he met a certain Joseph Michael Spangler, a singer
from St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, near the Hofburg. Haydn
knew Spangler very slightly but he poured his tale of
woe into sympathetic ears. Spangler was himself all but
a pauper. He lived in a garret with his wife and a nine-months-old
baby. Nevertheless he instantly begged his
distressed young friend to follow him home. Joseph
might sleep in the garret, which was a trifle better than
the cold street. About food Spangler could not guarantee,
since he and his little family had themselves barely
enough to subsist on.</p>
<p>Little by little Haydn set about making connections.
He played the violin at dances, he found a few pupils (at
absurdly low rates, it is true), he arranged for sundry
instruments some trifling compositions by musically illiterate
amateurs; or he participated in street serenades,
which were vastly popular in Vienna. Such &ldquo;Nachtmusiken&rdquo;
were more elaborate affairs than the love songs with
guitar accompaniment customary in Italy. Here trios,
quartets and even ensembles of wind-instruments performed
compositions of some length and diversity.
Crowds gathered, windows were filled with listeners and
the players earned money and applause. Haydn not only
played in these street performances, he wrote pieces for
use at them. The folk music of Vienna served him well
for this purpose, as did the melodies from those border
regions where he was born and which were tinged with
foreign strains and even exotic influences. In some incredible
way he made enough for several months to keep
body and soul together. Then a new problem developed.
The Spanglers expected a new baby and now the
wretched garret was definitely too small to house Haydn
any longer. The young musician got around his difficulties
temporarily by joining a party of pilgrims traveling
to the wonder-working shrine of the Virgin at Mariazell,
in one of the loveliest recesses of the Austrian Alps. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
voice having returned to him Haydn made an effort to
secure a position in the Mariazell church and appealed
to the choirmaster. That worthy was not impressed by
the newcomer&rsquo;s appearance and suspected a swindler
masquerading as an itinerant musician. Thereupon, the
story goes, Haydn resorted to a bold stratagem. He returned
to the church, made his way to the choir, suddenly
snatched a piece of music from an astonished singer
and sang it so beautifully that, as Geiringer relates, &ldquo;all
the choir held their breath to listen&rdquo;. As a result Haydn
was invited to stay a week as the choirmaster&rsquo;s guest and
actually earned a sum of money from the delighted
musicians of Mariazell. And luck, as he found, begets
luck. For soon afterwards, a certain Viennese tradesman,
Anton Buchholz, resolved to help the young man
carry on his studies and loaned him &ldquo;unconditionally&rdquo;
a sum of money which may well have seemed extraordinary
at this stage.</p>
<p>Haydn came back from his pilgrimage to Mariazell
rich enough to look for a garret of his own. He found
one, partitioned off from a larger room, on the sixth floor
of the old Michaelerhaus, adjoining St. Michael&rsquo;s
Church, at the south end of the Kohlmarkt. Both house
and church are still standing, looking to all intents as
they did in 1750. Haydn had plenty of neighbors in his
attic. Among them were a cook, a journeyman, a printer,
a footman, and a man who tended the fires in the house
of some rich man. Haydn had six hard flights to climb,
besides which there was no window, no stove, no conveniences
of any sort. If he wanted to wash in the morning
he had to get water from a nearby spring and by the
time he brought it up it had often turned to ice. But he
had a slight degree of privacy, enough quiet to study and
even to play on a ratty old clavier which, somehow or
other, he had managed to drag upstairs. He got hold of
a number of theoretical books&mdash;Johann Joseph Fux&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Gradus ad Parnassum,&rdquo; Mattheson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vollkommener
Capellmeister,&rdquo; Kellner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Unterricht im Generalbass&rdquo;&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
figuratively devoured them. And on his clavier he
played the first six piano sonatas of Philipp Emanuel
Bach. &ldquo;Innumerable times&rdquo;, he afterwards related, &ldquo;I
played them for my own delight, especially when I felt
oppressed and discouraged by worries; and always I left
the instrument gay and in high spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, however, he established two important
ties. One was the famous harlequin, Kurz-Bernardon,
who enjoyed an immense popular vogue by his clever
clowning and who managed the K&auml;rntnertor Theatre.
Kurz-Bernardon had an unusually beautiful wife, whose
blandishments justified numerous serenades. On one occasion,
when Haydn performed in one of these, the
comedian, struck by the music he heard, appeared at his
door to ask who had composed it. &ldquo;I did&rdquo;, answered
Joseph; whereupon the actor bade him &ldquo;Come upstairs!&rdquo;
Not only was he rewarded with an introduction to the
lady but, according to Carpani, Joseph left with an
opera libretto in his pocket and a commission to compose
it at once. The opera was called &ldquo;Der krumme
Teufel&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Limping Devil&rdquo;). Haydn wrote the music
in a couple of days, but as some nobleman imagined the
piece a lampoon on himself, the work was forbidden before
it was ever presented. One effect in the score the
composer admitted had given him more trouble than
&ldquo;writing a fugue with a double subject.&rdquo; This was a
musical description of a storm at sea which the play
called for. Now, neither Haydn nor Kurz-Bernardon had
ever seen the sea, let alone a storm on it! Carpani&rsquo;s tale
is most amusing: &ldquo;How can a man describe what he
knows nothing about? Bernardon, all agitation, paced
up and down, while the composer was seated at the
harpsichord. &lsquo;Imagine&rsquo;, said the actor, &lsquo;a mountain rising
and then a valley sinking, and then another mountain
and another valley....&rsquo; This fine description was of no
avail and in vain did the comedian add thunder and
lightning. At last, young Haydn, out of patience, extended
his hands to the two ends of the harpsichord and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
bringing them in a <i>glissando</i> rapidly together, he exclaimed:
&lsquo;The devil take the tempest!&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s
it&rsquo;, cried the harlequin, springing upon his neck and almost
stifling him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second acquaintance proved vastly more influential
than Kurz-Bernardon. In the same house&mdash;though
considerably further downstairs lived the great Pietro
Metastasio, author of innumerable opera librettos and
poet laureate to the Habsburgs. Metastasio, who may
have heard Haydn&rsquo;s improvisings from afar, was apparently
struck by them. He was interested in the musical
training of a friend and suggested the young pianist
up in the garret as a suitable teacher. Haydn was not
paid for his teaching in cash, but he enjoyed free board
and a cultured atmosphere. He became acquainted with
Metastasio, whose courtliness and sensibility could hardly
have failed to exercise a most advantageous effect upon
a youth so predisposed to benefit by genteel contacts.
Moreover, Haydn was equally fortunate in meeting his
pupil&rsquo;s singing master, the great voice teacher and famous
composer, Niccolo Porpora, who spent some years
in Vienna. Haydn acted as accompanist in these lessons
and soon begged to be taken into Porpora&rsquo;s employ as
pianist and pupil in singing and composition, in exchange
offering to do the now old and testy Italian every kind of
menial service. Surely it was worth an occasional cuff
and kick, he figured, even seasoned with a few &ldquo;blockheads&rdquo;,
if the great Porpora would take the trouble to
correct his musical exercises, give him an insight into the
deep secrets of singing and show him how best to write
for the voice. So he cheerfully brushed the old gentleman&rsquo;s
clothes, cleaned his shoes and saw that his wig was
on straight. For three months Haydn served his peppery
master. And in that time the young man made inestimable
progress of all sorts&mdash;one of which was to
acquire a fluent command of Italian.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Joseph, for all his ambition and diligence, may yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
have tasted a drop of bitterness when he reflected how
his brother, Michael, seemed still to outstrip him; and
when their mother died in 1754 she must have gone to
her grave persuaded that the truer musician of the
Haydn family was Michael who, at 17, was writing
masses of exceptional quality. Joseph was, indeed, gradually
gaining admission into noble circles. The Countess
Thun, for one, was so pleased by some of his sonatas that
she asked to make his acquaintance. Then, when he confronted
her face to face, she decided that this homely
and badly-dressed individual, could hardly be anything
but an impostor. Little by little the unfavorable impression
wore off and in due course the distinguished and extremely
musical lady was taking clavier and singing lessons
from the man she had mistaken for a hopeless booby.
Through her family Haydn met the very musical Karl
Joseph von F&uuml;rnberg, who had a steward, a pastor and
still another friend, all very proficient players. And it was
for F&uuml;rnberg and his intimates that Haydn wrote his first
string quartets. He was as industrious as ever. Carpani
said: &ldquo;At daybreak he took the part of the first violin at
the Church of the Fathers of the Order of Mercy; thence
he repaired to the chapel of Count Haugwitz, where he
played the organ; at a later hour he sang the tenor part
at St. Stephen&rsquo;s; and lastly, having been on foot all day,
he passed a part of the night at the harpsichord.&rdquo; Then,
in 1759, F&uuml;rnberg brought him to the attention of the
Bohemian Count Ferdinand Maximilian von Morzin,
who promptly engaged him as music director and
<i>Kammerkompositor</i>. Socially, financially and otherwise
Haydn had made a great step up the ladder, from which
he was destined never again to descend.</p>
<p>One of Haydn&rsquo;s duties at Count Morzin&rsquo;s was to accompany
the Countess Morzin when she chose to sing,
which was frequently. Once, according to Griesinger, the
lady was trying over some songs with Haydn when her
scarf became loose, exposing her bosom. Instantly,
Haydn stopped playing. The lady, irritated, asked the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
reason. &ldquo;But, your Highness, who would not lose his
head over this?&rdquo; he replied. This was only one of the
occasions he began to develop an eye for feminine
beauty. He was now maturing, physically, and his fortunes
were improving. This conjunction of circumstances
made him conclude that the time was ripe for him to
marry. It turned out to be one of the most unfortunate
inspirations of his life. Not that Haydn would have
failed to make a good husband, but for the reason that
it was his fate to pick the worst possible wife.</p>
<p>He gave lessons to the two daughters of a Viennese
hairdresser named Keller. It was not long before the
composer fell in love with the younger girl, whose name
was Therese. But Therese was afflicted with something
of a religious mania and, about 1760, she entered a convent,
as Sister Josepha. The hair-dresser, though a religious
man, wanted to keep the promising young musician
in the family, and before long he prevailed upon
him to consider his other daughter. The latter, Maria
Anna Aloysia Apollonia, offered the vilest imaginable
combination of qualities. She was hopelessly unmusical,
poisonously jealous, bigoted, ill-favored, slatternly, a
bad housekeeper and, as such women frequently are,
outrageously extravagant.</p>
<p>Haydn got nothing he had bargained for&mdash;neither affection,
home comforts nor children. So little regard did
Maria Anna Aloysia have for her husband&rsquo;s musical
eminence that she cheerfully used his manuscripts for
curl papers or else to line pie plates and cake pans.
Furthermore, said Haydn, &ldquo;my wife was unable to bear
children and for this reason I was less indifferent to the
attractions of other women&rdquo; (Griesinger). Some have
claimed that this Xantippe actually loved her husband,
on the grounds that she obstinately refused to give up a
certain picture of him. Dr. Geiringer says the composer
was so little deluded by this seeming show of affection
that he insisted his wife prized the portrait so highly only
because a lover of hers had painted it.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>At Maria Anna&rsquo;s invitation the house was overrun with
numberless priests, who were liberally entertained at the
Haydn residence and given orders for innumerable
masses, which were straightway charged to the composer&rsquo;s
account. She could never forget that her husband
had originally preferred her younger sister and she was
violently jealous of the attraction he never failed to
exercise on fascinating women. In his fluent Italian
Haydn once remarked to the French violinist, Baillot,
as he pointed out his wife&rsquo;s picture: &ldquo;E la mia moglie;
m&rsquo;ha ben fatta arrabiare!&rdquo; (&ldquo;That is my wife; she has
often infuriated me!&rdquo;). To an Italian singer, who held
a firm place in his heart, Haydn spoke many years
later of &ldquo;my wife, that infernal beast&rdquo;, who had plagued
him with such malicious letters that he had to threaten
he would never return to her. Geiringer believes that
Haydn &ldquo;must have felt a diabolical pleasure when he
came across the following Lessing poem for which he
composed a canon:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>If in the whole wide world</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>But one mean wife there is,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>How sad that each of us</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Should think this one is his!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Maria Anna Aloysia was further annoyed that her husband
should have spent so much on various poor relations;
in return, she gave considerable sums to the church.
When in 1800 she died while taking a cure at Baden,
Haydn seems to have received the news with complete
indifference.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Haydn composed his first symphony for the household
orchestra of Count Morzin. As a kind fate would have it
one of the guests who listened to the work was Prince
Paul Anton Eszterh&aacute;zy, of the powerful and enormously
wealthy Hungarian family. He was charmed by the
symphony and reflected what a priceless acquisition this
young composer would be for his court at Eisenstadt.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Here was a man reared in the grand tradition of the
Eszterh&aacute;zys, always noted for their encouragement of
music and other arts. Prince Paul, a talented composer
in his own right, collected numberless pictorial masterworks,
kept a small but trained orchestra and for
years had employed a now aging conductor, Gregorius
Joseph Werner.</p>
<p>It was only a short time after Paul Eszterh&aacute;zy had
visited the Morzins that the last-named noble found himself
in monetary straits. Among the first luxuries sacrificed
were the expensive orchestra and its conductor.
But instantly Haydn found a safer haven. Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy,
remembering the composer and conductor of the
enchanting symphony, acted at the first news of the
Morzin d&eacute;bacle to secure him for himself. Haydn, offered
the post of assistant conductor, accepted with delight.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>On May 1, 1761, Haydn received a contract, of great
length and elaborate detail, which is too extensive to
reproduce in all its particulars. Here, however, are a few
of its specifications:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Heyden shall be considered and treated as a
member of the household. Therefore his Serene Highness
is graciously pleased to place confidence in his conducting
himself as becomes an honorable officer of a princely house.
He must be temperate, not showing himself overbearing
toward his musicians, but mild and lenient, straightforward
and composed. It is especially to be observed that
when the orchestra shall be summoned to perform before
company, the Vice-Capellmeister and all the musicians
shall appear in uniform, and the said Joseph Heyden shall
take care that he and all the members of his orchestra follow
the instructions given and appear in white stockings,
white linen, powdered and with either a queue or a tie-wig....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said Vice-Capellmeister shall be under obligation
to compose such music as his Serene Highness may command,
and neither to communicate such compositions to
any other person, nor to allow them to be copied, but he
shall retain them for the absolute use of his Highness, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
not compose for any other person without the knowledge
and permission of his Highness....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said Joseph Heyden shall appear daily in the
antechamber before and after midday, and inquire whether
his Highness is pleased to order a performance of the
orchestra.... The said Vice-Capellmeister shall take careful
charge of all music and musical instruments, and be
responsible for any injury that may occur to them from
carelessness or neglect.... The said Joseph Heyden shall
be obliged to instruct the female vocalists, in order that
they may not forget in the country what they have been
taught with much trouble and expense in Vienna; and
since the Vice-Capellmeister is proficient on various instruments
he shall take care himself to practice on all that he
is acquainted with.... A yearly salary of 400 florins to be
received in quarterly payments is hereby bestowed by his
Serene Highness upon the said Vice-Capellmeister. In addition,
the said Joseph Heyden shall board at the officers&rsquo;
table, or receive half a gulden per day in lieu thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Serene Highness undertakes to keep Joseph Heyden
in his service for at least three years; and should he be
satisfied with him, he may look forward to being appointed
Capellmeister....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Eisenstadt was to be Haydn&rsquo;s home for the next thirty
years, and in the service of the Eszterh&aacute;zys he was to do
much&mdash;though by no means all&mdash;of his greater work.
The palace of Eszterh&aacute;za was a modest place when the
composer first joined the Eszterh&aacute;zy staff compared with
the gorgeous domain it became not very long afterwards.
Haydn was, if you will, a servant. He wrote music to
order and went, properly attired, at certain times of day,
to receive the prince&rsquo;s directions. Dr. Geiringer says: &ldquo;To
await the commands of so exalted a personage as Prince
Eszterh&aacute;zy ... was not humiliating for a man who had
only recently risen from the depths of poverty.&rdquo; Even
the fact of having to wear livery did not irk him. We are
told that old Mathias Haydn (who died in 1765) still
lived &ldquo;to experience the joy of seeing his son in the
princely blue uniform braided with gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Prince Paul Eszterh&aacute;zy was gathered to his fathers in
1762. Haydn became the servitor of an Eszterh&aacute;zy
who artistically was greatly the superior of Paul Anton.
This one was Prince Nicholas, surnamed &ldquo;the Magnificent&rdquo;,
because of his love of splendor and the wealth
which enabled him to indulge his most luxurious tastes.
He now undertook to erect a palace which rivaled Versailles
and which, in fact, was a glorified imitation of
the French model. Eszterh&aacute;za became a vast dream palace
compared to the one where Haydn had first assumed his
new post. It is impossible to give here even the faintest
idea of the splendor and sumptuousness of this &ldquo;Hungarian
Versailles&rdquo;. An opera house and a theatre for
puppet shows formed part of this superlative show-place;
and concert rooms suited whatever kind of musical performances
might be commanded by the prince. When
distinguished guests arrived the brilliancy of the festivities
arranged for their enjoyment knew no limits. The
Empress Maria Theresia visited the Eszterh&aacute;zy estate in
1773 and a special booklet published in Vienna gives
an account of the festivities on that occasion, which
reads like something out of the Arabian Nights. One
of the musical works performed was Haydn&rsquo;s little
lyric comedy, &ldquo;L&rsquo;infedelt&agrave; delusa&rdquo;. The Empress was so
delighted that she is said to have remarked: &ldquo;If I want
to enjoy good opera, I go to Eszterh&aacute;za.&rdquo; On the same
evening there was a superb masked ball, following which,
in the Chinese Pavilion, the orchestra, in brilliant uniforms,
played a number of pieces under Haydn&rsquo;s leadership,
one of them the conductor&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Maria Theresia&rdquo;
Symphony. The ball continued all night, though the
Empress&mdash;understandably enough&mdash;had retired. Next
day she heard another Haydn opera (for marionettes),
&ldquo;Philemon and Baucis&rdquo;, which Maria Theresia enjoyed
so much that she had the whole production sent to
Vienna for her entertainment. Haydn received the usual
snuff-box filled with gold pieces. He, in return, presented
the imperial lady with three grouse he had shot down;
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the Empress &ldquo;graciously accepted them&rdquo; and took them
home for dinner!</p>
<p>But all this is anticipating. When Haydn settled at
Eszterh&aacute;za he found at his disposal a competent orchestra,
but one much smaller and less capable than it soon
became. The newcomer, though the aged and desiccated
Gregorius Joseph Werner remained nominally chief
Capellmeister and railed at Haydn as &ldquo;a mere fop&rdquo; and
a &ldquo;scribbler of songs&rdquo;, lost no time reorganizing his
forces, yet very tactfully and without ruffling any feelings.
He infused new blood into the personnel, by acquiring
a number of young and greatly talented players.
One of these was a youthful violinist, Luigi Tomasini,
whom Prince Paul Anton had found in Italy and taken
to Eszterh&aacute;za as his valet, and whom Haydn instantly
secured for his orchestra and treated as a brother. Still
another was a cellist of uncommon gifts, Joseph Weigl.
Haydn obtained the musical results he wanted, but always
with the discretion of a born diplomat. Never had
he to fight his &ldquo;superiors&rdquo;, after the manner of such
stormy petrels as Bach, Handel, Beethoven. His musicians
(he always referred to them as his &ldquo;children&rdquo;)
idolized him and, because they respected him, strove to
satisfy his demands, which were by no means slight. His
duties were staggeringly heavy. Dr. Geiringer recounts
that, on one occasion, the exhausted Haydn became so
sleepy while writing a horn concerto that he &ldquo;mixed up
the staves for oboe and violin, and noted in the score as
an excuse &lsquo;written while asleep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It was not long before the musicians fell into the habit
of calling their conductor &ldquo;Papa Haydn&rdquo;, on account of
his solicitude for their well-being and his musical knowledge
which they recognized as remarkable. But nothing
could be more misleading than the age-old convention
of using &ldquo;Papa Haydn&rdquo; as a nickname for this master as
if to imply that he was an artist of outworn, discredited
sympathies and of unprogressive attitude. The antique
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
&ldquo;Papa Haydn&rdquo; idea was neatly scuttled on one occasion
by Anton Rubinstein&mdash;of all people! When someone of
his acquaintance alluded contemptuously to &ldquo;Papa
Haydn&rdquo; the great pianist retorted: &ldquo;Let me assure you
that long after I have become &lsquo;great-grandfather Rubinstein&rsquo;
he will still continue to be &lsquo;Papa Haydn&rsquo;.&rdquo; Yet
Haydn at the time of which we speak was still some distance
from the master who created the greater symphonies
and chamber music, the finest clavier sonatas
and certain other memorable keyboard works, let alone
the six most inspired masses and the two oratorios (&ldquo;The
Creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Seasons&rdquo;), the ripest fruits of his
old age. If physically Haydn developed late, the same is
true of his creative genius. Musically and otherwise it
appeared for some time as if his brother, Michael, would
surpass him; and if Joseph had died soon after entering
the Eszterh&aacute;zy service it may be seriously questioned if
the world would have felt it had been deprived of an
irreplaceable master.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In more ways than one the sumptuous palace of Eszterh&aacute;za
was the best possible home for Haydn&rsquo;s art. Prince
Eszterh&aacute;zy, great as were his demands on Haydn, did his
art a service by allowing him to experiment and thus
&ldquo;forcing him to become original&rdquo;. He would hardly have
become &ldquo;original&rdquo; in the way he did had he been obliged
to earn his bread wandering about Vienna, for he was
differently constituted than, let us say, such an unmistakably
Viennese soul as Schubert. Haydn&rsquo;s early masters
(let us rather say &ldquo;models&rdquo;) were not men of imposing
creative dimension. Johann Sebastian Bach died
while Haydn was still a youth, his work had gone out of
fashion and was unobtainable in Vienna for years to
come. But the influence of Philipp Emanuel Bach was
vastly stronger at the time than that of his father and
Haydn, as we have seen, felt its impact. Guido Adler,
for one, names as Haydn&rsquo;s early masters minor composers
like Georg Reutter, Georg Christoph Wagenseil
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and Georg Matthias Monn. There is evidence that he
knew the music of Ignaz Holzbauer, Johann Stamitz and
the Sammartini brothers. Basically more important for
Haydn&rsquo;s early style was the changed taste which pervaded
the musical world, supplanting the intricate polyphonic
style by homophony and the decorative pleasings
of the so-called <i>style galant</i>.</p>
<p>It was some time before he can be said to have earned
the title of &ldquo;father of the symphony&rdquo; (or, in the deepest
sense, of the sonata or the string quartet). The early
symphonies of Haydn seem much closer to the concerto
grosso of the Baroque period than to the later &ldquo;Paris&rdquo;
and &ldquo;London&rdquo; symphonies. The musical form which occupied
Haydn perhaps most of all was the string quartet,
of which as many as 83 were enumerated in a catalogue
of his works Haydn prepared in 1805. &ldquo;We do not know
the exact number of Haydn&rsquo;s string quartets,&rdquo; declares
Karl Geiringer, who also adds &ldquo;the composer was in his
early twenties when he wrote his first quartet and he had
passed his 70th birthday before he began to work on his
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In 1766 Gregorius Werner died and Haydn was officially
appointed Capellmeister of the Eszterh&aacute;zy orchestra.
He had by now brought the ensemble to a high state
of perfection. Besides the cellist Weigl (who later joined
the Vienna court orchestra) Haydn could boast, in addition
to &ldquo;brother Luigi&rdquo; Tomasini, as concertmaster, the
fine cellists, Franz Xaver Marteau and Anton Kraft.
Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy, who paid even higher salaries than
the imperial court at Vienna, could have his pick and
choice of any artist he wanted. The schedule at Eszterh&aacute;za
called for two opera performances a week, two
weekly concerts and, in Prince Nicholas&rsquo; private salon,
plenty of chamber music. The prince greatly enjoyed
playing the baryton, a now obsolete form of viola da
gamba. It was uncommonly difficult and the Prince enjoyed
it all the more for that reason. Haydn had his
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
work cut out for him supplying his employer with new
music for the instrument. Once he thought he would
give Prince Nicholas pleasure by learning to play the
baryton himself and declared he was ready to play it
for his Serene Highness. This time he had miscalculated&mdash;his
Highness returned no more than a glacial stare!
Nicholas, moreover, insisted he must have <i>all</i> the most
difficult passages in anything Haydn might write for
him. The cellist, Kraft, was once given a particularly
easy part in a baryton duet to perform with the prince,
who cut short any possible argument with the words:
&ldquo;It is no credit to you to play better than I do; it is your
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The normal schedule of the artists was, of course, far
heavier and more complicated, when distinguished visitors
arrived for longer or shorter sojourns. Under the
circumstances, neither Haydn nor anyone else, had a
chance to be bored at Eszterh&aacute;za. Now and then, however,
these birds in a golden cage longed for a little freedom.
Haydn himself once wrote in a letter: &ldquo;I never can
obtain leave, even to go to Vienna for twenty-four hours.
It is scarcely credible, and yet the refusal is always
couched in such polite terms as to render it utterly impossible
for me to urge my request.&rdquo; This is the place to
speak of the so-called &ldquo;Farewell Symphony&rdquo;, a piece of
music with a definite purpose (if not exclusively an
artistic one) in which Haydn got the better of his prince.
In 1772 Nicholas ruled that none of the musicians might
bring his wife or children to Eszterh&aacute;za. In only three
cases was an exception made. Prince Nicholas, having
paid his musicians an extra fifty florins to provide for
the families they were not permitted to visit, considered
that he had no further obligations. Finally, the players
who had to pass the greater part of the year without
seeing their wives, rebelled. In Griesinger&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The
affectionate husbands appealed to Haydn to help them.
Haydn decided to write a symphony in which one instrument
after the other ceases to play. The work was
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
executed as soon as an occasion presented itself, and each
player was instructed to put out his candle when his part
was ended, seize his music and leave with his instrument
tucked under his arm. The prince instantly understood
the meaning of pantomime and the next day he gave the
order to leave Eszterh&aacute;za.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, the advantages of Haydn&rsquo;s life at Eszterh&aacute;za,
even when it threatened to grow dull, were inestimable.
He once told Griesinger: &ldquo;My prince was always
satisfied with my works. Not only did I have the
encouragement of constant approval, but as conductor
of an orchestra I could make experiments, observe what
produced an effect and what weakened it, and was thus
in a position to improve, to alter, make additions or
omissions, and be as bold as I pleased. I was cut off from
the world; there was no one to confuse or torment me....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy, in 1779, engaged an Italian violinist,
Antonio Polzelli, and his wife, Luigia, a mezzo-soprano.
Polzelli was a sickly man and not particularly competent.
Still less was Luigia, who needed much help from
Haydn to fit her for minor musical duties. What moved
the Prince to pick this misfit pair for his establishment
is a problem. They were not a happy couple, scarcely
more than were Haydn and his &ldquo;Infernal Beast&rdquo;! Luigia
was nineteen, lively, graceful&mdash;an adorable type of
Italian beauty. The Prince soon decided that the imported
couple represented a needless expense, though
the two were pathetically underpaid. But this time
Haydn was resolute. The Polzellis must stay in Eszterh&aacute;za
under <i>any</i> conditions! Eszterh&aacute;zy, being a man of
the world, realized that in certain things an irreplaceable
orchestral conductor must be allowed his way, whatever
the conventions.</p>
<p>Luigia was attracted to Haydn as were numerous other
women whose path he crossed. He himself often admitted
it could not have been for his beauty. Dr.
Geiringer says that we know &ldquo;practically nothing about
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Luigia.&rdquo; At any rate Haydn never made any secret of his
love for her or she for him&mdash;not, at any rate, till much
later, when new interests entered his life. At Eszterh&aacute;za
the affair was an open secret. Doubtless they would
have married. But the invalid Antonio and the venomous
Maria Anna Aloysia settled that. There are no letters
extant dealing with those first years of their love. But in
1791 he wrote Luigia: &ldquo;I love you as on the first day,
and I am always sad when I cannot do more for you.
But be patient, perhaps the day will arrive when I can
show you how much I love you.&rdquo; When Antonio Polzelli
died, not very long afterwards, Haydn wrote Luigia:
&ldquo;Perhaps the time will come, for which we have so often
wished when two pairs of eyes will be closed. One is shut
already but what of the other? Well, be it as God wills.&rdquo;
Luigia had two sons, the first born in 1777, the second
six years later, in Eszterh&aacute;za. Haydn was devoted to both,
and gossip insisted he was the father of the younger. He
taught the two boys music and, irrespective of the question
of paternity, he made no distinction between them.
Singularly enough, &ldquo;the Infernal Beast&rdquo; who abominated
Luigia, showed herself exceptionally kind to Pietro Polzelli
when he visited her in 1792.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>About 1781 Haydn established a friendship which was
to grow increasingly profound and more influential. He
made the acquaintance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
who had come from Salzburg to settle at last in Vienna.
The sympathy was mutual, though the two masters were
in many ways the absolute reverse of each other. Mozart
was from his childhood a genuine virtuoso, such as
Haydn had never pretended to be. Neither had Haydn
matured artistically with anything like the speed of the
sensitive and mercurial genius from Salzburg, nor possessed
anything like the universality of the latter&rsquo;s gifts.
Be these things as they may, the pair seemed to have
come into the world to complement one another. Their
friendship is one of the most beautiful and productive
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the history of music affords. &ldquo;Haydn was fascinated by
Mozart&rsquo;s quicksilver personality, while Mozart enjoyed
the sense of security that Haydn&rsquo;s steadfastness and
warmth of feeling gave him.&rdquo; And it was as if the two
kindled brighter artistic sparks in their respective souls.
The two played chamber music together whenever
Haydn made a trip to Vienna. When Leopold Mozart
visited his son, in 1785, Wolfgang, Haydn and several
friends performed some of Mozart&rsquo;s new quartets
for Father Mozart. It was on this occasion that Haydn
made to Leopold the oft-quoted remark: &ldquo;I tell you
before God and as an honest man that your son is the
greatest composer known to me either in person or by
reputation. He has taste and, what is more, the most profound
knowledge of composition.&rdquo; Wolfgang was delighted,
but declared at the same time that it was only
from Haydn that he had learned how to write string
quartets. And the half-dozen he issued in 1785 and dedicated
with moving phrases to his &ldquo;beloved friend Haydn&rdquo;
are doubtless among the finest he composed. On the other
hand, Mozart never permitted a derogatory word to be
said in his presence about Haydn. And when the Bohemian
composer and pianist, Leopold Kozeluch, once said
to Mozart on hearing a boldly dissonant passage in a
Haydn quartet: &ldquo;I would never have written that,&rdquo; Mozart
instantly retorted: &ldquo;Nor would I! And do you know
why? Because neither you nor I would have had so excellent
an idea.... Sir, even if they melted us both together,
there would still not be stuff enough to make a Haydn.&rdquo;
When some years later Haydn was asked his opinion
about a debated passage in &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; he answered
with finality: &ldquo;I cannot settle this dispute, but this I
know: Mozart is the greatest composer that the world
now possesses!&rdquo; And hearing an argument about the harmony
in the beginning of Mozart&rsquo;s C major Quartet
Haydn put a stop to the controversy then and there by
saying: &ldquo;If Mozart wrote it so he must have had good
reason for it.&rdquo; And when someone in Prague invited
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Haydn to write an opera for that city he declined on the
ground&mdash;among other things&mdash;that he &ldquo;would be taking
a big risk, for scarcely any man could stand comparison
with the great Mozart. Oh, if I could only explain to
every musical friend ... the inimitable art of Mozart, its
depth, the greatness of its emotion, and its unique musical
conception, as I myself feel and understand it, nations
would then vie with each other to possess so great a jewel....
Prague ought to strive not merely to retain this
precious man, but also to remunerate him; for without
this support the history of any great genius is sad indeed.
It enrages me to think that the unparalleled Mozart has
not yet been engaged by some imperial or royal court. Do
forgive this outburst but I love that man too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It should not be imagined that the various operas of
Haydn have anything like the vitality, the dramatic life
or the quality of &ldquo;theatre&rdquo; we find in the stage works of
Mozart. The greater part were composed for the play-house
at Eszterh&aacute;za and in certain cases for marionettes.
Sometimes they were slender comedies, on the &ldquo;Singspiel&rdquo;
order, sometimes masques, intermezzi, scenic
cantatas. Possibly the two operas which in modern times
have experienced most frequent revival are the comedy,
&ldquo;Lo Speziale&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Apothecary&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Il Mondo
della Luna&rdquo; (&ldquo;The World of the Moon&rdquo;).</p>
<p>His life at Eszterh&aacute;za had the advantage of preserving
Haydn from the intrigues and jealousies that ran riot in
Vienna and from which even a Mozart had to suffer so
bitterly. Yet without traveling far from Eisenstadt Haydn
was now rapidly becoming widely famous. One of the
first countries where he gained glory in distinguished
circles was Spain. In 1779 his music was already becoming
a subject of high-flown poetic praise. In 1781
King Charles III sent the composer a gold snuffbox. The
secretary of the Spanish Legation went to Eszterh&aacute;za in
person to convey his sovereign&rsquo;s esteem to Haydn, whose
princely employer must have swelled with pride at such
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
a lofty distinction so ceremoniously conferred upon his
&ldquo;servant&rdquo;. The composer, Luigi Boccherini, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of
the Spanish king&rsquo;s brother, strove so successfully to
imitate Haydn&rsquo;s style that someone called him &ldquo;Haydn&rsquo;s
wife&rdquo;. Perhaps the most important Spanish honor of all
came from a canon of Cadiz for a work called &ldquo;The
Seven Last Words of Our Saviour on the Cross&rdquo;. Let us
cite Haydn&rsquo;s own words which preface the score published
by Breitkopf und H&auml;rtel in 1801:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 1786 I was requested to compose instrumental
music in &lsquo;The Seven Last Words.&rsquo; It was customary at
the Cathedral of Cadiz to produce an oratorio every year
during Lent, the effect of the performance being not a
little enhanced by the following circumstances. The
walls, windows, and pillars of the church were hung
with black cloth, and only one large lamp hanging from
the center of the roof broke the solemn obscurity. At
midday the doors were closed and the ceremony began.
After a short service the bishop ascended the pulpit,
pronounced the first of the seven words and delivered a
discourse thereon. This ended, he left the pulpit and
prostrated himself before the altar. The pause was filled
by music. The bishop then in like manner pronounced
the second word, then the third, and so on, the orchestra
following on the conclusion of each discourse. My composition
was subject to these conditions, and it was no
easy matter to compose seven adagios to last ten minutes
each, and succeed one another without fatiguing the
listeners; indeed, I found it quite impossible to confine
myself within the appointed limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haydn looked upon the composition as one of his most
important and, as a matter of fact, it widely exercised a
profound impression. It was even performed in the
United States in 1793. When it came to paying Haydn
for his work the Spanish ecclesiast presented the composer
with a large sum of money concealed in an enormous
chocolate cake! The &ldquo;Seven Last Words&rdquo; were,
in the course of years, done by a string quartet, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
an orchestra, as an oratorio. Today the work is hard to
listen to with patience, impressive as it once seemed. A
series of adagios, one much like the other, it has precisely
the effect that the composer at first feared: the
various movements as they succeed one another end by
sorely &ldquo;fatiguing the hearers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>France and England, in their turn, presently developed
unmistakable signs of Haydn worship, which
progressed increasingly. In Italy the composer steadily
won favor. The Philharmonic Society of Modena made
him a member as early as 1780. Ferdinand IV, of Naples,
a few years later ordered concertos for an instrument
called the lira organizzata. The king wanted Haydn to
visit Italy; the composer would have loved to do so, but
could not leave Eszterh&aacute;za. Frederick William II, of
Prussia, who played the cello, sent Haydn a superb and
costly diamond ring. We are told that he put on the ring
whenever he began an important work because &ldquo;when
he forgot to do so no ideas occurred to him&rdquo;. He also
received a costly ring from his pupil, the Russian Grand
Duchess Maria Feodorovna, whom he taught in 1782 in
Vienna and for whom he composed numerous songs more
than twenty years later. Then, in 1781, Haydn informed
the Viennese publisher, Artaria, that &ldquo;Monsieur Le Gros,
director of the Concerts Spirituels in Paris, wrote me a
great many nice things about my &lsquo;Stabat Mater&rsquo; which
had been given there four times with great applause....
They made me an offer to engrave all my future works on
very advantageous terms.&rdquo; In 1784 a Paris society, the
Concerts de la Loge Olympique (patronized by French
royalty, and where audiences were required to pass a
kind of examination before they were admitted to its
functions) commissioned Haydn to write six symphonies
for them, to which solicitation we owe the composer&rsquo;s
great series of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; Symphonies. Not only did French
publishers now make profitable proposals to Haydn; in
Luigi Cherubini, meanwhile, he had one of his most
impassioned advocates in Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Haydn could probably have gone to England and become
associated with the musical life of that country
much sooner than he did. When in 1783 the Professional
Concerts were founded in London an attempt was made
to secure him to take over their direction. The composer,
not feeling that Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy would have given his
consent, had to refuse and the English public contented
itself with listening to a Haydn symphony as the opening
offering of the series. By that time Haydn&rsquo;s music was
so well known and stood so high in British favor that his
works had gained a preponderant place in the musical
life of the country. The Prince of Wales, an excellent
cellist, caused Haydn&rsquo;s quartets to be performed continually
at the palace musicales. And invitations to come
to England poured upon Haydn from every corner of the
Island Kingdom. For all that, he remained as simple
and unspoiled as ever. He never forgot his humble origin.
To Griesinger he once said: &ldquo;I have had intercourse with
emperors, kings and many a great personage, and have
been told by them quite a few flattering things. For all
that, I do not care to be on intimate terms with such persons
and prefer to keep to people of my own station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Vienna the number of Haydn&rsquo;s intimates steadily
increased. As the years of his sojourn at Eszterh&aacute;za passed
pleasantly, but monotonously, the composer strove increasingly
to widen his Viennese circle of friends. He
was able to accomplish this without unusual effort. The
publisher, Artaria, who had close business connections
with Haydn, was only one of the master&rsquo;s cronies. Then,
of course, there were Mozart and his friends Michael
Kelly, Stephen and Nancy Storace, the merchant
Michael Puchberg (who immortalized himself by lending
Mozart money). And Haydn, following the suggestion
of Mozart and Puchberg, became a Freemason and
joined the lodge Zur wahren Eintracht. But in some ways
the closest friends of Haydn&rsquo;s in Vienna were Peter L.
von Genzinger and his wife, Marianne. Von Genzinger
had long been Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy&rsquo;s doctor. Both he and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
wife were to the highest degree cultured and musical&mdash;Frau
von Genzinger, for that matter, was an uncommonly
gifted pianist and singer. Haydn was so welcome a guest
in that hospitable dwelling that, among other things, his
hostess never tired of preparing for him his favorite
dishes. The only drop of bitterness the lovely Genzinger
home brought him was the poignant contrast it sometimes
furnished to the growing monotony of Eszterh&aacute;za,
to which place he returned with a pang. &ldquo;Well here I sit
in my wilderness, like some poor orphan, almost without
human society, melancholy, dwelling on the memory of
past glorious days&rdquo;, he wrote to Marianne von Genzinger,
in 1790, after he had mournfully returned to Eszterh&aacute;za.
His letters to Marianne have a freedom and a spontaneity
not to be found in Haydn&rsquo;s usually stilted
correspondence. As time passed it became fairly evident
that Haydn deeply, if hopelessly, loved her. To be sure,
he wrote that &ldquo;she need be under no uneasiness ... for
my friendship and esteem for you (warm as they are)
can never become reprehensible since I have always in
my mind my respect for your elevated virtues, which not
only I, but all who know you must reverence.... Oh,
that I could be with you, dear lady, even for a quarter of
an hour, to pour forth all my sorrows, and to receive
comfort from you! Well, as God pleases! This time will
also pass away and the day return when I shall again
have the inexpressible pleasure of being seated beside
you at the pianoforte, hearing Mozart&rsquo;s masterpieces,
and kissing your hands from gratitude for so much
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the lines it is possible to read that for all his
honors and distinctions Haydn was not growing happier
at Eszterh&aacute;za as the years elapsed. By 1790 we find him
writing: &ldquo;I am doomed to stay at home. It is indeed sad
always to be a slave.&rdquo; He was growing restive amid
all this Eszterh&aacute;zy luxury. He had his orchestra, his
palatial little theatre, the unending festivities at Eszterh&aacute;za;
he had Luigia Polzelli and he had little occasion to
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
bother about the &ldquo;Infernal Beast&rdquo;, who, though she still
walked the earth, scarcely existed for him. But it irked
him that he could not accept those invitations to visit
foreign countries which were piling in upon him. The
truth, as Dr. Geiringer keenly observes, was that &ldquo;Haydn
had outgrown Eszterh&aacute;za.... Even his attachment to
his beloved prince had somewhat diminished. Haydn,
now a man of nearly 60, like a person of half his age,
craved for a change, new tasks, new experiences. With the
sure instinct of genius he felt that the immense creative
forces still slumbering in him could be released only by a
cleancut break with the way of life that for nearly 30
years had been dear to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>At the psychological moment destiny came to Haydn&rsquo;s
aid somewhat as, decades later, it invariably came to
Wagner&rsquo;s. In the fall of 1790, Prince Nicholas the
Magnificent died suddenly. His successor, Prince Anton
Eszterh&aacute;zy, who was unmusical and otherwise unlike his
father, instantly dismissed the orchestra, retaining only
Haydn, Tomasini and a few others to take care of the
church music. He did not, indeed, discharge Haydn and
even paid him well to keep him nominally in his employ.
But he gave the master leave to travel wherever he
wanted. Instantly Haydn dashed to Vienna, where fate
took charge of his interests once more. A relative of the
Eszterh&aacute;zys wanted him for another princely post at
Pressburg; the king of Naples repeated his earlier invitation
to Italy. Then, while the composer deliberated, a
stranger burst into his room with the words: &ldquo;My name
is Salomon. I have come from London to fetch you; we
shall conclude our accord tomorrow.&rdquo; Haydn was bowled
over and almost before he realized the truth, Johann
Peter Salomon, of Bonn, superintended everything.
Haydn was to be paid 300 pounds for an opera, 300 more
for six new symphonies, 200 for the copyrights, 200 for
twenty smaller pieces, 200 more for a benefit concert in
London. He had, then and there, to consider whether it
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
was to be Pressburg, Italy or England. One reason he decided
against Italy was because he appreciated that he
was not a born opera composer, like Mozart. But though
Haydn spoke Italian and knew not a word of English
(besides which the Channel crossing worried him), he
decided&mdash;most fortunately as it proved&mdash;on England.
For one thing, he realized that England was at that time
a leader in the orchestral field; in the second place Haydn
was surfeited with nobility and the courts of princes. And
he longed for the personal freedom which England assured
him. So London it should be! His friends&mdash;among
them Mozart&mdash;were frightened. &ldquo;Oh, Papa, you have had
no education for the wide world, and you speak so few
languages,&rdquo; protested Wolfgang. &ldquo;But my language is
understood all over the world,&rdquo; gently replied Haydn.
Just the same, he found parting from Mozart harder than
from any of his other friends. And when they took leave
of one another the younger man exclaimed prophetically:
&ldquo;I am afraid, Papa, this will be our last farewell.&rdquo; Mozart&rsquo;s
death was one of the sorest blows Haydn ever
suffered, and the pain of it actually sharpened with the
passing of time.</p>
<p>Ten days before Christmas, 1790, Haydn set out on
his journey with Salomon. They took ship at Calais,
January 1, 1791, at 7:30 A.M. (&ldquo;after attending early
Mass&rdquo;). As he wrote Marianne von Genzinger, he was
&ldquo;very well, although somewhat thinner, owing to fatigue,
irregular sleep, and eating and drinking so many things&rdquo;.
In spite of a choppy sea he stood the crossing admirably,
probably because &ldquo;I remained on deck during the whole
passage, in order to gaze my fill at that huge monster,
the ocean.&rdquo; Only once or twice was he &ldquo;seized with slight
alarm and a little indisposition likewise&rdquo;. Yet he arrived
at Dover &ldquo;without being actually sick&rdquo;, even if most of
the passengers did &ldquo;look like ghosts.&rdquo; Doubtless he recalled
with amusement his boyish attempts to portray a
storm at sea on the harpsichord in the days of Kurz-Bernardon!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Haydn&rsquo;s first impressions of London were overwhelming.
He was as struck and delighted with the size and
grandeur of the British metropolis, its crowds, its teeming
traffic and the &ldquo;strangeness&rdquo; of English life as was
even the worldlier Mendelssohn, several decades later.
Nevertheless, he was not a little frightened and found
the street noise &ldquo;unbearable&rdquo;. He had not a little trouble
with the language and was much confused about the
right thing to do when people drank his health. He
wrote to Frau von Genzinger that he was trying to learn
English by taking morning walks alone in the woods
&ldquo;with his English grammar.&rdquo; Salomon did not spare
him any of the customary social engagements and amenities.
Before he had been in London three weeks he was
invited to a court ball and welcomed by the Prince of
Wales, who, so Haydn decided, was &ldquo;the handsomest
man on God&rsquo;s earth&rdquo;. The Prince (the future George
IV) &ldquo;wore diamonds worth 80,000 pounds.&rdquo; Haydn
eventually managed to secure a recipe for the Prince&rsquo;s
brand of punch; it called for &ldquo;one bottle of champagne,
one of burgundy, one of rum, ten lemons, two oranges
and a pound and a half of sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On March 11, 1791, occurred Haydn&rsquo;s first concert in
the Hanover Square Rooms. The function in every respect
exceeded the composer&rsquo;s fondest hopes. Its outstanding
feature was the D major Symphony (No. 93).
The orchestra surpassed both numerically and otherwise
the one Haydn had commanded at Eszterh&aacute;za. The
master conducted from a harpsichord, as had always
been his custom. The concertmaster was the worthy
Salomon, who played on a superb Stradivarius. Dr.
Burney spoke of &ldquo;a degree of enthusiasm such as almost
amounted to frenzy.&rdquo; The Adagio of the symphony had
to be repeated. The <i>Morning Chronicle</i> wrote: &ldquo;We cannot
suppress our very anxious hope that the first musical
genius of the age may be induced by our liberal welcome
to take up his residence in England.&rdquo; It was a wish which
speedily spread. Even the King pressed the composer to
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
make his home there and when, with the best grace in
the world Haydn assured him his Continental obligations
would not permit him to do so, the monarch was more
or less offended. One reason the master gave for his
refusal was that &ldquo;he could not leave his wife&rdquo;&mdash;though
the &ldquo;Infernal Beast&rdquo; was probably farthest from his
thoughts! What really stood in the way of a permanent
English residence was the fear of the tremendous drain
on his creative powers his popularity might entail. He
was, indeed, on the threshold of his greatest achievements
and he was strong and healthy. All the same he was not
growing younger. And he knew what the strain of being
incessantly lionized would do in the long run.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, British adulation only
had the effect of making Haydn more splendidly productive
than ever. The twelve Salomon symphonies (six
composed for Haydn&rsquo;s first visit to London, the remaining
set written for his second a few years later) are indisputably
Haydn&rsquo;s greatest symphonic creations. Let
us mention a few of them: There is the so-called &ldquo;Military&rdquo;
Symphony (Haydn&rsquo;s symphonies are more easily
distinguished by their sometimes fanciful titles, than by
keys or opus numbers); the &ldquo;Clock&rdquo;, with its Andante,
marked by a persistent tick-tock rhythm; the symphony
&ldquo;With the Kettledrum Roll&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Surprise&rdquo;, with its
folk-like melody and its title derived from a wholly unexpected
fortissimo (which Haydn believed would
&ldquo;wake up the old ladies&rdquo;) following a placid folk-like
phase&mdash;yet actually more of a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; from the
astonishing harmonies heard just before the close of the
variation movement.</p>
<p>The London Symphonies, together with &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Seasons&rdquo; as well as certain of the great
string quartets, parts of which so astoundingly foreshadow
the idiom of the Romantic period, are, in reality,
the summits of Haydn&rsquo;s inspiration. It is a question if
his genius would have unfolded itself so magnificently
without the stimulus which came to the master from his
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
two visits to England. In July, 1791, he was invited to
the Oxford Commemoration to receive from the University
the honorary degree of Doctor of Music. The
occasion proved to be a love feast. Three concerts were
given in Haydn&rsquo;s honor, at one of which he conducted his
G major Symphony (No. 92), written several years
earlier, but henceforth called the &ldquo;Oxford&rdquo; Symphony.
As his &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; he wrote for the University a three part
crab canon, &ldquo;Thy Voice, O Harmony is Divine&rdquo;. For
three days he went about in &ldquo;cherry and cream-colored
silk&rdquo;. &ldquo;I wish my friends in Vienna could have seen me&rdquo;,
he wrote, remarking in his diary &ldquo;I had to pay one and
a half guineas for the bell peals at Oxford when I received
the Doctor&rsquo;s degree, and half a guinea for hiring
the gown. The journey cost six guineas.&rdquo; By no means a
cheap honor! At the same time it is worth-while mentioning
a statement of his to Dies, his biographer: &ldquo;I
owe much, I might say everything in England to the
Doctor&rsquo;s degree; for thanks to it I met the first men and
was admitted to the most important houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Haydn&rsquo;s greatest and most fruitful experiences
in London was his attendance in 1791 at a huge Handel
Commemoration in Westminster Abbey. It was a prodigious
affair with more than a thousand participants.
Handel&rsquo;s masterpieces may not have been intimately
familiar to Haydn, though the Baron Van Swieten in
Vienna made a cult both of Handel and Johann Sebastian
Bach. In Westminster Abbey, however, with such a
gigantic array of performers and a public brought up in
the reverence of Handel&rsquo;s masterpieces the effect of a
creation like &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was no less than shattering on
Haydn. When he heard the &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; chorus he burst
into tears with the exclamation &ldquo;Handel is the master of
us all!&rdquo; And it seems to have been the impact of Handel
which moved him to contemplate an oratorio of his own.
The outcome of this Handelian experience and of
the great British tradition of massive choruses became,
in due time, &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Seasons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Haydn was immensely busy in England but he was
thoroughly enjoying himself. He was entertained for
five entire weeks at the home of a rich banker who
lived in the country and who asked Haydn to give
music lessons to his daughters, yet tactfully left the composer
as much alone as he wished to be. So he was able
to rest a little from the noise of London. Another time
he went by boat from Westminster Bridge to Richmond
and had dinner on a lovely island in the Thames; or he
went to a dance at the home of the Lord Mayor of London,
leaving when he found the room too hot and the
music too bad; then he remained for three days at a
castle where the Duke of York and his bride were spending
their honeymoon. &ldquo;Oh, my dear good lady&rdquo;, he
exclaimed in a letter to Marianne von Genzinger, &ldquo;how
sweet is some degree of liberty! I had a kind prince, but
was obliged at times to be dependent on base souls. I
often sighed for release and now I have it in some
measure. I am quite sensible of this benefit, though my
mind is burdened with more work. The consciousness of
being no longer a servant sweetens all my toil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a concert given in York House, where Haydn
played, Salomon led an orchestra and the King and
Queen were present, the composer was formally presented
by the Prince of Wales to George III. The
monarch talked for some time to the former &ldquo;servant&rdquo;
of the Eszterh&aacute;zys and said, among other things, &ldquo;Dr.
Haydn, you have written a good deal.&rdquo; Whereupon
Haydn answered: &ldquo;Yes, Sire, a great deal more than is
good.&rdquo; The King had the last word, however, and replied:
&ldquo;Oh, no; the world contradicts you.&rdquo; There can
be no question, however, that on both his visits to England
Haydn was called upon to subject his creative
powers to a terrific strain. The strangest part of it was
that the artist, whose years were now accumulating,
seemed actually to be making up for the slow development
of his genius in his young manhood. Not only were
the works he produced greater and greater, but his assimilation
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
of great and new musical influences was progressing
steadily.</p>
<p>Apart from his other English activities there was no
end of sight-seeing to be done, complicated with a considerable
amount of teaching. At the end of the music
season the &ldquo;worn out&rdquo; master, went to Vauxhall Gardens,
was delighted with the place where, among other things
the music was &ldquo;fairly good&rdquo; and where &ldquo;coffee and milk
cost nothing&rdquo;. However, he did have a few twinges of
the &ldquo;English rheumatism&rdquo; and almost submitted to an
operation for his nose polypus&mdash;though when they tied
him to a chair and prepared to operate he &ldquo;kicked and
screamed so vigorously&rdquo;, that the surgeon and his assistants
had to give it up.</p>
<p>Not even a Haydn escaped intrigues and baseless
slander. A rival concert organization, unable to win him
away from Salomon launched rumors that the composer
was showing signs of exhaustion and then sought to play
off against Haydn the aging master&rsquo;s devoted pupil,
Ignaz Pleyel. Another thing he seems not to have managed
avoiding was a love affair. &ldquo;There were certainly
quite a few innocent friendships with beautiful women&rdquo;,
relates Dr. Geiringer, &ldquo;but they did not prevent the inflammable
master from enjoying a more significant
romance as well&rdquo;. Strangely enough, we know about it
only from the letters of the lady in question, which
Haydn carefully copied because, presumably, she wanted
her correspondence back! So far as we have this interchange
it is quite one-sided and none of Haydn&rsquo;s letters
to her remain. The lady in the case was a widow, a
Mrs. Schroeter. Dr. Burney referred to her as &ldquo;a young
lady of considerable fortune&rdquo;. Later, Haydn spoke of
her to Dies, as &ldquo;an English widow in London who loved
me. Though 60 years old, she was still lovely and amiable,
and in all likelihood I should have married her if I had
been single.&rdquo; Like Marianne von Genzinger, Mrs.
Schroeter was musical and did copyist work for the
composer. Actually, she seems to have been much
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
younger than Haydn&rsquo;s estimate. Here are a few extracts
from the letters he received from her in London:
&ldquo;... Pray inform me how you do, and let me know my
Dear Love: When will you dine with me? I shall
be truly happy to see you to dinner, either tomorrow
or Tuesday.... I am truly anxious and impatient
to see you and I wish to have as much of your company
as possible; indeed my dear Haydn I feel for
you the fondest and tenderest affection the human heart
is capable of, and I ever am with the firmest attachment
my Dear Love, most Sincerely, Faithfully and most affectionately
Yours...&rdquo;. Another time, the devoted Mrs.
Schroeter is concerned about his health: &ldquo;I am told you
was (sic!) at your Study&rsquo;s yesterday; indeed, my D.L.,
I am afraid it will hurt you.... I almost tremble for
your health. Let me prevail on you my much loved
Haydn not to keep to your study&rsquo;s so long at one time.
My dear love if you could know how precious your welfare
is to me, I flatter myself you wou&rsquo;d endeavor to
preserve it, for my sake as well as your own.&rdquo; Another
time: &ldquo;... I hope to hear you are quite well, shall be
happy to see you at dinner and if you can come at three
o&rsquo;clock it would give me great pleasure, as I should be
particularly glad to see you my Dear before the rest of
our friends come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, Haydn amid his numberless duties,
found time to write to Luigia Polzelli, who was now in
Italy. She was not a little jealous and the composer
found it wise to placate her with extravagantly ardent
letters and money. He would have been happy to see
her son, Pietro, in London but he was much less anxious
to have Luigia. Meantime, the &ldquo;Infernal Beast&rdquo; again
stirred up trouble by sending notes to her detested rival
hinting at Haydn&rsquo;s infidelities!</p>
<p>Let us herewith end the story of Luigia. Haydn had
once promised to marry her when he should be free.
When, at long last Maria Anna Apollonia died in 1800,
the Polzelli chose to remind him of his promise. But he
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
solved the difficulty by giving her black on white, his
solemn word to marry &ldquo;no one else&rdquo; and he also promised
her a substantial pension for the rest of her life. Having
pocketed that &ldquo;promise&rdquo; Luigia promptly married an
Italian singer! Her son, Pietro, died in 1796. Haydn sincerely
mourned him but turned his attention to another
pupil of his, Sigismund Neukomm.</p>
<p>The wanderer came back to Vienna in midsummer,
1792. After the exhilaration of the first English trip the
return to Vienna, for all his honors and distinctions, was
chilling. No one seemed to care greatly. Moreover, there
was one irreplaceable loss; Mozart was no more; and
early in 1793 another blow struck Haydn&mdash;Marianne
von Genzinger died at 38. Here was a calamity in its way
rivaling the tragedy of Mozart. Haydn&rsquo;s resilient nature
recovered even from the death of Marianne. But a certain
sweetness departed with her and never returned.
Singularly enough, there entered into his musical life
about this time a force one might assume would have
fortified him to bear the burden of his poignant losses.
Beethoven arrived in Vienna from Bonn bearing the following
message from Count Waldstein: &ldquo;Dear Beethoven,
you are traveling to Vienna in fulfillment of your
long-cherished wish. The tutelary genius of Mozart is
still weeping and bewailing the death of her favorite.
With the inexhaustible Haydn she has found refuge, but
no occupation, and now she is waiting to leave him and
associate herself with someone else. Labor assiduously
and receive Mozart&rsquo;s spirit from the hands of Haydn.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Haydn was the wrong teacher for Beethoven and
Beethoven the wrong pupil for Haydn. The young man&rsquo;s
relations with the old master were kind and friendly
(Beethoven, according to his diaries, treated Haydn to
&ldquo;chocolate twenty-two times&rdquo; and to &ldquo;coffee six times&rdquo;).
But there was a spiritual gulf between them of which
they both became aware. Haydn, indeed, foreshadowed
musical romanticism, yet he did not, like his new pupil,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
arrogantly identify himself with it. Beethoven had none
of that soul of a servitor which Haydn had acquired
through his long career; so it was not without reason that
the teacher used to allude to the hot-headed pupil as
&ldquo;the Grand Mogul&rdquo;. Moreover, Beethoven wanted to be
instructed in counterpoint the hard way; and he was
greatly irritated when Haydn did not carefully correct
his technical exercises. Therefore, though the relationship
remained outwardly amicable and the lessons went
on, Beethoven changed teachers. He placed himself in
the hands of the composer, Johann Schenk, and of the
contrapuntist, Johann Albrechtsberger. As Schenk had
told Beethoven in looking over some of his technical
work, Haydn was now too busy composing great masterworks
to be occupied by the needs of a particularly
obstreperous student.</p>
<p>In 1794 Haydn started out a second time for London,
but this time not in Salomon&rsquo;s company. Yet as he did
not wish to make the journey unattended he decided on
one of his young friends for an escort&mdash;Polzelli,
Beethoven or some other. His usual luck attended him
when he picked Johann Elssler, whose father had copied
music at Eszterh&aacute;za. Johann was Haydn&rsquo;s godson and in
the fullness of time he became the father of the famous
dancer, Fanny Elssler. He idolized Haydn, served him
hand and foot, was secretary, copyist and the first to
assist Haydn in cataloguing his works. On this English
visit Haydn traveled rather more extensively than the
first time. He went to the Isle of Wight, to Southampton,
to Waverly Abbey, to Winchester. He went to Hampton
Court, which reminded him of Eszterh&aacute;za. He heard
&ldquo;miserable trash&rdquo; at the Haymarket Theatre and even
worse at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells. In Bath he met a Miss Brown,
&ldquo;an amiable discreet person&rdquo;, who had the additional
advantage of &ldquo;a beautiful mother&rdquo;; he saw the grave of
&ldquo;Turk, a faithful dog and not a man&rdquo;; and he composed
music to a poem by the conductor of the Bath Harmonic
Society, &ldquo;What Art Expresses&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In August, 1795, Haydn was back in Vienna, and although
the heart-breaks of the previous return were
spared him he found plenty of new organizational labor
awaiting him at Eszterh&aacute;za, where a new prince, Nicholas
II, a grandson of &ldquo;The Magnificent&rdquo; now held sway.
His artistic tastes, though pronounced, did not run primarily
in the directions of music. He gave Cherubini a
gorgeous and costly ring, he liked the music of Reutter
and Michael Haydn more than that of the great Eszterh&aacute;zy
Capellmeister, and then insulted Beethoven with a
stupid remark about the latter&rsquo;s C major Mass. He even
criticised Haydn&rsquo;s management of some detail at an
orchestral rehearsal, whereupon the now thoroughly
irascible master turned on his patron with a wrathy:
&ldquo;Your Highness, it is my job to decide this!&rdquo; He felt
now that a Doctor of Music at Oxford should be addressed
more respectfully than simply as &ldquo;Haydn&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In London the composer once said: &ldquo;I want to write
a work which will give permanent fame to my name in
the world.&rdquo; After his numberless symphonies, his
masses, his clavier works, his vast store of chamber music,
his concertos, his operatic miscellany, his songs and
arias&mdash;after all these what could remain? England had
given him one unrivaled experience from which he could
nourish his genius&mdash;the mighty Handel Commemoration,
in Westminster Abbey. Haydn had experimented
in countless forms, but one. That was the oratorio and in
this he could undertake new flights.</p>
<p>Where should he find a subject? Some say that a
musical friend of Haydn&rsquo;s answered the master by opening
a Bible standing handy and exclaiming: &ldquo;There!
Take that and begin at the beginning!&rdquo; Others maintain
that Salomon gave him a libretto which one Lidley had
pieced together from Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; for
Handel. Dr. Geiringer believes that both accounts may
be true. At all events, Haydn returned to Vienna with
the text. It was, however, in English, which Haydn
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
understood imperfectly. It was necessary, consequently,
to find an accomplished translator. As usual, good fortune
attended him. Gottfried van Swieten, a literatteur,
prefect of the Vienna Royal Library, friend of Mozart,
worshipper of Handel and Bach, who thought highly of
Haydn, was wealthy even if despotic, yet still after a
fashion musical&mdash;this man was able to furnish Haydn
what he required. Nay, more, &ldquo;he got together a group
of twelve music-loving noblemen and each guaranteed a
contribution to defray the expenses of performance and
pay an honorarium to the composer.&rdquo; And Haydn set
jubilantly and, withal, reverently to work. He &ldquo;spent
much time over it, because he intended it to last a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The labor gave him extraordinary happiness. It answered
his inmost wants. Here he could give the freest
possible rein to all that inborn optimism of his nature.
Always profoundly religious, as free from doubt and
skepticism as a child, his reverence was as sincere as it
was sunny. Here he walked, literally, &ldquo;hand in hand with
his God&rdquo;. There came to the surface, moreover, all those
springs of folk-song influence which were either remembered
or subconsciously wrought into the fabric of his
being. And he was now working on a newer and larger
scale than hitherto. &ldquo;Never was I so devout as when
composing &lsquo;The Creation&rsquo;&rdquo; he afterwards said. &ldquo;I knelt
down every day and prayed to God to strengthen me in
my work.&rdquo; If his inspiration ever threatened to grow
sluggish &ldquo;I rose from the pianoforte and began to say
my rosary&rdquo;. This cure, he insisted, never failed.</p>
<p>The curious aspect of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; is that, though
composed to a German translation of the English text,
it is one of those rare masterpieces which actually sound
better in a translation than in the original. The answer
to this springs probably from the circumstance that &ldquo;The
Creation&rdquo; is, in point of fact, an Anglo-Saxon heritage.
An examination of numerous details of its setting and
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
declamation make it clear that, almost subconsciously,
Haydn has set and accompanied the English words in
more subtly revealing fashion than the German. Similarly,
Haydn achieved in the whole work that effect at
which he was aiming. Writing to her daughter, the
Princess Eleanore Liechtenstein said of the oratorio,
&ldquo;One has to shed tears about the greatness, the majesty,
the goodness of God. The soul is uplifted. One cannot
but love and admire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first performance of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; was given
at the palace of Prince Schwarzenberg in Vienna on
April 29, 1798. Only invited guests attended this and the
second performance, though the mobs outside were so
great that extra detachments of police had to be summoned.
Haydn conducted, not from a keyboard, but in
the modern way, with a baton. The rendering was
superb, the audience enraptured. Haydn himself said
later: &ldquo;One moment I was as cold as ice, the next I
seemed on fire. More than once I was afraid I should
have a stroke.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; promptly spread over
the world. In England it &ldquo;was to prove so unfailing an
attraction that proceeds from it, mostly given to charitable
institutions, by far surpassed even the receipts from
the London benefit concerts that once had seemed so
extraordinary to Haydn&rdquo;. In Paris Bonaparte was on his
way to hear a performance of it when a bomb exploded
in the street through which he was passing, narrowly
missing his carriage. In America it took root in short
order.</p>
<p>The score deserves, in reality, a much more detailed
scrutiny than can be given here. The introduction, the
&ldquo;Representation of Chaos&rdquo;, does not receive the attention
it actually merits. There is a warmth of color to the
writing, particularly to the woodwind, which is something
new in Haydn. And the closing bars of the amazing
page are the more startling because they provide a foretaste
of one of the most striking passages in Wagner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tristan und Isolde&rdquo;. It may be mentioned, in passing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
that this is by no means the only time when Haydn affords
an amazing Wagnerian presage.</p>
<p>The great and even more celebrated moment in the
opening choral number of the oratorio is the passage
&ldquo;Let there be Light and there was Light&rdquo;. From a thin,
gray C minor we are suddenly overwhelmed with a sudden
and mighty C major chord&mdash;an unmistakable sunburst
in tone. In all music this tremendous moment has
not its like unless it be a similar episode&mdash;also a sunrise
and by curiously related means&mdash;at the opening of
Richard Strauss&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;. From the
very first this moment in &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; overpowered
the listeners and after a century and a half it has lost not
a vestige of its glory. At his last appearance in a concert
hall, Haydn, only a few weeks from his end, was taken
to a performance of his work. At this episode the old
master pointed upwards with the words &ldquo;Not from me&mdash;from
there, above, comes everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strain of unending toil was beginning to tell on
Haydn, though the amazing aspect of it is that these
latest works of his do not betray the slightest diminution
of freshness or inventive powers. Yet on June 12, 1799,
he wrote to Breitkopf und H&auml;rtel a letter which deserves
attention: &ldquo;My business unhappily expands with my advancing
years, and it almost seems as if, with the decrease
of my mental powers, my inclination and impulse
to work increase. Oh God! how much yet remains to be
done in this splendid art, even by a man like myself!
The world, indeed, daily pays me many compliments,
even on the fervor of my latest works; but no one can
believe the strain and effort it costs me to produce them,
inasmuch as time after time my feeble memory and the
unstrung state of my nerves so completely crush me to
earth, that I fall into the most melancholy condition.
For days afterwards I am incapable of formulating one
single idea, till at length my heart is revived by providence,
and I seat myself at the piano and begin once
more to hammer away at it. Then all goes well again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
God be praised. I only wish and hope that the critics
may not handle my &lsquo;Creation&rsquo; with too great severity
and be too hard on it. They may possibly find the musical
orthography faulty in various passages, and perhaps
other things also, which for so many years I have been
accustomed to consider as minor points, but the genuine
connoisseur will see the real cause as readily as I do, and
willingly ignore such stumbling blocks. This, however,
is entirely <i>entre nous</i>; or I might be accused of conceit
and arrogance, from which, however, my Heavenly
Father has preserved me all my life long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haydn had still a prodigious amount of work before
him. Chief of all was another full length oratorio, &ldquo;The
Seasons&rdquo;, based on James Thomson&rsquo;s didactic poem.
Here again the Baron Van Swieten edited and translated,
though he made use of several German poems in
addition to Thomson&rsquo;s (of which he altered the &ldquo;unhappy&rdquo;
ending). The composer worked for three years
on &ldquo;The Seasons&rdquo;, not completing it till 1801. It seems
to have tested his powers sorely. It was no less optimistic
a document than &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo;, but by and large an
outspoken Nature piece (conceived in Rousseau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Back
to Nature&rdquo; philosophy), yet with only transient religious
undertones and without the genuinely Biblical quality
of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo;. Still, the truly amazing part of &ldquo;The
Seasons&rdquo; is its incessant vitality, the charm of its pictorial
aspect and the unending freshness of its inspiration.
All the same, the magnificent work made unmistakable
inroads on Haydn&rsquo;s vitality. He paid for its
success with his health and was in the habit of saying,
from now on, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Seasons&rsquo; has given me the death
blow!&rdquo; Actually, he had suffered a physical breakdown
of a sort shortly after one of the productions of &ldquo;The
Creation&rdquo;. He had to take to his bed and, intermittently,
the flow of his inspiration threatened to halt. But invariably
he would recover, both physically and mentally.
He revised his earlier &ldquo;Seven Last Words&rdquo; as an oratorio;
he arranged 250 Scotch folksongs for the Edinburgh
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
publisher, George Thomson; the number of his string
quartets increased. Performances of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo;
multiplied everywhere. Honors poured in upon him from
all quarters. He was warmly invited to come to Paris
and his old pupil, Pleyel, was dispatched to fetch him.
Fortunately, Haydn spared himself the exertions of such
a trip. Still, France struck a medal in his honor, which
gave the master no end of pleasure; and he received the
warmest expressions of affection from the inhabitants of
the little Baltic island of R&uuml;gen, where a performance of
&ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; was given. He even strove to be his own
publisher and sought subscriptions for the score of the
oratorio. His friends rallied magnificently to his aid&mdash;the
English royal family, the Empress of Austria, the
innumerable friends from his native country and from
Britain (England as much as Austria now claimed him
as one of her very own!). Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton
visited Eszterh&aacute;za and it is said that for two days
the Lady &ldquo;would not budge from Haydn&rsquo;s side&rdquo;, while
Nelson gave him a gold watch in exchange for the
master&rsquo;s pen!</p>
<p>The great composition of this later period of Haydn&rsquo;s
life is beyond dispute his patriotic anthem, &ldquo;Gott erhalte
Franz den Kaiser&rdquo;&mdash;the Austrian hymn, as, through
thick and thin, it has remained. That, too, was indirectly
a product of his English experiences! He had always
been stirred in London by &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; and it
became his ambition to provide something similar for
his own nation. The great melody that resulted bears a
distinct resemblance to a Croatian folksong of the Eisenstadt
region, &ldquo;Zalostna zarucnica&rdquo;, which certain musicologists
maintain served as the inspiration for Haydn&rsquo;s
melody, though the derivation has not been definitely
established. But others than Austrians have made the
song their own. The Germans, for instance, consorted it
to a poem by Hoffmann von Fallersleben and thereby
it became &ldquo;Deutschland &uuml;ber alles&rdquo;; the English-speaking
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
nations put it to churchly uses and made of it
the hymn &ldquo;Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While he was still engaged in exacting creative
work he set a schedule for himself which he appears to
have followed rigorously. A daily plan of activities
(written by Elssler, Dr. Geiringer surmises) furnishes a
picture of &ldquo;Herr von Haydn&rsquo;s&rdquo; routine. He was living in
a house he had bought in the &ldquo;Gumpendorfer&rdquo; district
of Vienna. We read that &ldquo;in the summertime he
rose at 6.30 A.M. First he shaved, which he did for
himself up to his 73rd year, and then he completed
dressing. If a pupil were present, he had to play his
lesson on the piano to Herr von Haydn, while the master
dressed. All mistakes were promptly corrected and a new
task was then set. This occupied an hour and a half. At
8 o&rsquo;clock sharp, breakfast had to be on the table, and
immediately after breakfast Haydn sat down at the piano
improvising and drafting sketches of some composition.
From 8 o&rsquo;clock to 11.30 his time was taken up in this
way. At 11.30 calls were received or made, or he went
for a walk until 1.30. The hour from 2 to 3 was reserved
for dinner, after which Haydn immediately did some
little work in the house or resumed his musical occupations.
He scored the morning&rsquo;s sketches, devoting three
to four hours to this. At 8 P.M. Haydn usually went out
and at 9 he came home and sat down to write a score or
he took a book and read until 10 P.M. At that time he
had supper, which consisted of bread and wine. Haydn
made a rule of eating nothing but bread and wine at
night and infringed it only on sundry occasions when he
was invited to supper. He liked gay conversation and
some merry entertainment at the table. At 11.30 he went
to bed, in his old age even later. Wintertime made no
difference to the schedule, except that Haydn got up
half an hour later.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>But despite this pleasant and comfortable routine
Haydn was now beginning to age rapidly. On December
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
26, 1803, he conducted for the last time and, characteristically,
for a hospital fund, the work he directed being
the &ldquo;Seven Last Words&rdquo;. He wrote two movements of a
string quartet, but by 1806, he had given up all idea of
finishing it and, as a conclusion, added a few bars of a
song he had written in the past few years, &ldquo;Der Greis&rdquo;,
which begins &ldquo;Hin ist alle meine Kraft, alt und schwach
bin ich&rdquo; (&ldquo;Gone is all my strength, old and weak am I&rdquo;).
Friends and admirers in ever increasing numbers sought
him out to pay their respects. There came Cherubini,
the Abb&eacute; Vogler, the violinist Baillot, Pleyel, members
of the Weber family, Mme. Bigot&mdash;a friend of Beethoven
and afterwards one of the piano teachers of Felix and
Fanny Mendelssohn; Hummel, the widow of Mozart,
the Princess Eszterh&aacute;zy, the actor, Iffland.</p>
<p>In 1805 a rumor gained currency that Haydn had died.
The world was shocked. Cherubini even composed a
cantata on Haydn&rsquo;s passing; Kreutzer a violin concerto
based on themes from Haydn&rsquo;s works, while in Paris a
special memorial concert was arranged and Mozart&rsquo;s
Requiem was to be given. Suddenly there came a letter
from the master saying that &ldquo;he was still of this base
world.&rdquo; And he thanked his French admirers for their
well-meant gestures adding &ldquo;had I only known of it in
time, I would have traveled to Paris to conduct the
Requiem myself!&rdquo; Johann Wenzel Tomaschek told how
Haydn greeted any visitor who might drop in: &ldquo;He sat
in an armchair, very much dressed up. A powdered wig
with sidelocks, a white neckband with a bold buckle, a
white richly embroidered waistcoat of heavy silk, in the
midst of which shone a splendid jabot, a dress of fine
coffee-colored cloth with embroidered cuffs, black silk
breeches, white silk hose, shoes with large silver buckles
curved over the instep, and on a little table next to him
a pair of white kid gloves made up his attire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made one last public appearance. It was at a performance
of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; given at the Vienna University
in celebration of the master&rsquo;s 76th birthday.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
About the only person of prominence not present was
Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy; but he at least sent his carriage to
bring the master to the concert! At the hall were assembled
not alone the high nobility but all the most
distinguished musicians of the capital, among them
Beethoven, Salieri, Hummel, Gyrowetz. Salieri conducted.
The concertmaster was Franz Clement, for
whom Beethoven wrote his violin concerto. The French
ambassador, seeing Haydn wearing the gold medal of
the Parisian Concerts des Amateurs, exclaimed: &ldquo;This
medal is not enough; you should receive all the medals
that France can distribute!&rdquo; The Princess Eszterh&aacute;zy
not only sat next to the master but wrapped her own
shawl about him. It was on this occasion that Haydn
made his historic remark when the audience burst into
applause at the sublime passage &ldquo;And there was Light.&rdquo;
As the concert progressed he became visibly excited and
it was thought advisable to take him home. As Haydn
left the auditorium Beethoven knelt down before him
and reverently kissed his hand and brow. Before the old
man finally vanished from view he turned one last time
and lifted his hand in blessing on the assemblage.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>By the spring of 1809 the Napoleonic wars were again
devastating Austria. The bombardment of the western
suburbs of Vienna brought the battle uncomfortably
close to Haydn&rsquo;s home. Nevertheless, the master refused
to leave and when a bomb fell close to the
Gumpendorfer house the old man reassured his frightened
servants with the words: &ldquo;Children, don&rsquo;t be frightened;
where Haydn is, nothing can happen to you!&rdquo; But
the continuous noise and excitement shook the invalid&rsquo;s
nerves so severely that he took to his bed and left it only
once. This was to be carried to his piano, there to play
three times in succession and with the deepest possible
feeling his own Austrian hymn, as if to defy those
hostile powers unwilling to let him die in peace. On
the same day, however, he was visited by a French officer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
Cl&eacute;ment Sul&eacute;my, who called to pay his respects to the
composer of &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; and who, before he left,
sat down at the piano and sang the aria &ldquo;In Native
Worth&rdquo; &ldquo;in so manly and so sublime a style, with so
much truth of expression and musical sentiment&rdquo; that
Haydn embraced him and said he had never heard the
air delivered in so masterly a fashion. Sul&eacute;my fell in
battle the same day, a fact which the composer, fortunately,
never learned.</p>
<p>But his strength was now quite gone. He could only
whisper to those about him: &ldquo;Children, be comforted,
I am well.&rdquo; Then he lapsed into unconsciousness and
shortly after midnight, May 31, 1809, he passed. Napoleon
saw to it that a military guard of honor was stationed
at his door. At his obsequies not only the cultural world
of Vienna but also the highest French military officials
were present. And Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem was sung.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The story cannot be ended without an allusion to its
macabre epilogue. Haydn was laid to rest in the Hundsturm
Cemetery. But soon afterwards Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy
received permission to reinter the master in Eisenstadt.
There were lengthy delays, however, and in 1814 Sigismund
Neukomm was shocked to find the tomb in a state
of dilapidation. He placed on it a marble slab with
Haydn&rsquo;s favorite quotation from Horace, &ldquo;Non omnis
moriar&rdquo; (&ldquo;I shall not wholly die&rdquo;), set as a five part
canon. Six years later the Duke of Cambridge remarked
to Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy &ldquo;How fortunate was the man who
employed this Haydn in his lifetime and now possesses
his mortal remains!&rdquo; The Prince said nothing, but experienced
a sharp twinge of conscience. So he gave
orders for the exhumation and the reburial in the Eisenstadt
Bergkirche, where Haydn had conducted a number
of his masses. When the coffin was opened the officials
were appalled to find a body without a head! It developed
that a certain Carl Rosenbaum, once a secretary
to Prince Eszterh&aacute;zy, and a penitentiary official, one
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
Johann Peter, had bribed the Viennese gravedigger, to
steal the skull which they wanted for phrenological experiments.
Peter had made an elaborately decorated box
(with windows and a satin cushion) for the gruesome
relic. The outraged Prince sent the police to Peter, who,
meantime had given the skull to Rosenbaum. The police
were quite as unsuccessful at the Rosenbaum house, for
the singer, Therese Gassmann Rosenbaum, promptly
hid the skull in her mattress and went to bed, pretending
illness. The hideous farce went a step further, when
Rosenbaum, expecting a bribe, substituted the head of
some unidentified old man. When Rosenbaum died he
left Haydn&rsquo;s skull to Peter, obligating him to bequeath
it to the museum of the Society of the Friends of Music,
in Vienna, where it was preserved since 1895.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Nazis, after the Austrian
Anschluss in 1938, proposed to bury the head in Haydn&rsquo;s
coffin at Eisenstadt. Whether they carried out this plan
is not known to the present writer.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
